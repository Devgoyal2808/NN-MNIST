# Neural-Network-Implementation-for-XOR

Neural Network helps to move from linear function to non linear function as output making results for our model more effective.

We basically combine different linear models in layers to make a resultant model b/w input and predictions non linear.
we than apply Gradient Descent on this model to find best possible solution with minimized cost and error.

Considered Cost: Error + (lamba)
